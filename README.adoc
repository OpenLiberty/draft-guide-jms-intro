= Producing and consuming messages in Java microservices

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to produce and consume messages to communicate between Java microservices in a standard way by using the Jakarta Messaging API with the embedded Liberty Messaging Server or an external messaging server, IBM MQ.

== What you'll learn

You’ll learn how to communicate between Java web services when one service is producing a continuous stream of asynchronous messages or events to be consumed by other services, rather than just sending and receiving individual requests for data. You will also learn how to use a messaging server and client to manage the production and consumption of the messages by the services.

In this guide, you will first use the embedded Liberty Messaging Server to manage messages, then you will optionally switch to using an external messaging server to manage the messages, in this case, https://www.ibm.com/products/mq[IBM MQ^]. You might use an external messaging server if the messaging mechanism is important to your application (e.g. during a bank transfer in a banking application). None of your messages are lost if there is a system overloading or outage.

You will learn how to write your Java application using the Jakarta Messaging API which provides a standard way to produce and consume messages in Java application, regardless of which messaging server your application will ultimately use.

The application in this guide consists of two microservices, `system` and `inventory`. Every 15 seconds, the `system` microservice computes and publishes a message that contains system’s current CPU and memory load usage. The `inventory` microservice subscribes to that information at the `/systems` REST endpoint so that it can keep an updated list of all the systems and their current system loads.

You’ll create the `system` and `inventory` microservices using the Jakarta Messaging API to produce and consume the messages using the embedded Liberty Messaging Server.

image::architecture.png[Application architecture where system and inventory services use the Jakarta Messaging to communicate.,align="center"]

You will then, optionally, reconfigure the application, without otherwise changing the Java code, to use an external IBM MQ messaging server instead.

== Additional prerequisites

To complete the optional *Using IBM MQ as the messaging server* section in this guide, install Docker if it is not already installed. You will use an IBM MQ container as the external messaging server. For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to build and install the `models` module. The `models` module contains the `SystemLoad` data class for both the `system` and `inventory` microservices to use.
```
cd finish
mvn -pl models clean install
```

Start the `inventory` microservice by running the following command:
```
mvn -pl inventory liberty:run
```

Next, open another command-line session, navigate to the `finish` directory, and start the `system` microservice by using the following command:
```
mvn -pl system liberty:run
```

When you see the following message, your Liberty instances are ready:
[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Visit the http://localhost:9085/health[^] URL to confirm that the `inventory` microservice is up and running.

When both the liveness and readiness health checks are up, go to the http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems[^] URL to access the `inventory` microservice. You see the `systemLoad` property for all the systems:

[source, role='no_copy']
----
{
   "hostname": <your hostname>,
   "systemLoad": 6.037155240703536E-9
}
----

You can revisit the http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems[^] URL after a while, and you will notice the `systemLoad` property for the systems changed.

You can also use `curl` command to retrieve the `hostname` and `systemLoad` information from the `inventory/systems` server endpoint in another command line session:
```
curl http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems
```

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Liberty instances by pressing `CTRL+C` in each command-line session where you ran Liberty. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `finish` directory in another shell session:
// stopping dev mode
[role='command']
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:stop
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
----


== Creating the consumer in the inventory microservice

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-jms-intro/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], dev mode listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change.

Run the following goal to start the `inventory` microservice in dev mode:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:dev
----

When you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

The `inventory` microservice records in its inventory the recent system load information that it received from potentially multiple instances of the `system` microservice.

----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryQueueListener.java[]
----
The `inventory` microservice receives the messages from the `system` microservice. Implement the [hotspot=InventoryQueueListener file=0]`InventoryQueueListener` class with the `MessageListener` interface and annotate with [hotspot=messageDriven file=0]`@MessageDriven` to monitor the `jms/InventoryQueue` message queue. Implement the [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`onMessage()` method that processes the incoming messages, updates the inventory by using the [hotspot=InventoryManager hotspot=InventoryManagerUpdate file=0]`InventoryManager` bean, and logs the action. Use the [hotspot=systemLoad file=0]`SystemLoad.fromJson()` method to convert the JSON message string to the `SystemLoad` object.

Next, configure the `inventory` microservice with an embedded messaging server and the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/messagingClient-3.0.html[Messaging Server Client^] feature.

The [hotspot=messagingServer file=1]`messagingServer` feature enables a Liberty runtime to host an embedded messaging server to manage messaging destinations. The [hotspot=messagingClient file=1]`messagingClient` feature enables applications to connect to a Liberty messaging server and access the messaging destinations hosted on that server through the Jakarta Messaging API that is enabled by the [hotspot=messaging file=1]`messaging` feature.

Add the [hotspot=wasJmsEndpoint file=1]`wasJmsEndpoint` element to configure the Liberty runtime to monitor and manage incoming JMS connections from any hosts. Set up the [hotspot=messagingEngine file=1]`messagingEngine` configuration to ensure that the Liberty runtime can manage incoming message queues more effectively, assigning a reliable and persistent destination for the `InventoryQueue`. Configure a [hotspot=jmsConnectionFactory file=1]`jmsConnectionFactory` element to use the [hotspot=connectionManager file=1]`InventoryCM` connection manager and set properties for the JMS implementation. Define a [hotspot=jmsQueue file=1]`jmsQueue` element for the `InventoryQueue` message queue with its JNDI name and a [hotspot=jmsActivationSpec file=1]`jmsActivationSpec` element to configure properties, including the queue listener class name and maximum concurrency.

To learn more about configuration for the `jmsQueue` element and `jmsConnectionFactory` element, see the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/jmsQueue.html[JMS Queue^] and https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/jmsConnectionFactory.html[JMS Connection Factory^] documentation.


== Creating the message producer in the system service 

Open another command-line session, navigate to the `start` directory, and run the following goal to start the `system` microservice in dev mode:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
----

When you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

The `system` microservice is the producer of the messages that are published to the messaging server as a stream of events. Every 15 seconds, the `system` microservice triggers an event that calculates the recent CPU usage for the last minute.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemService` class.#
`system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemService.java`
----

SystemService.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemService.java[]
----
The `SystemService` class contains the [hotspot=sendSystemLoad file=0]`sendSystemLoad()` method that calculates the recent system load, creates a [hotspot=SystemLoad file=0]`SystemLoad` object, and publishes the object as a message to the [hotspot=jms/InventoryQueue file=0]`jms/InventoryQueue` message queue running in the messaging server by using the [hotspot=createProducer file=0]`send()` method. The [hotspot=schedule file=0]`@Schedule` annotation on the `sendSystemLoad()` method sets the frequency at which the system service publishes the calculation to the event stream, ensuring it runs every 15 seconds.


Next, configure the `system` microservice to access the message queue.

[role='code_command hotspot file=1', subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the system's `server.xml` configuration file.#
`system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

system/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=messaging file=1]`messaging` and [hotspot=messagingClient file=1]`messagingClient` features enable the Liberty runtime to provide the required messaging services. Add a [hotspot=connectionManager file=1]`connectionManager` element to handle connections for the messaging server running on the `inventory` microservice. Define the [hotspot=jmsConnectionFactory file=1]`jmsConnectionFactory` element to use the [hotspot=connectionManager file=1]`InventoryCM` connection manager and set up the required [hotspot=jms hotspot=propertiesWasJms file=1]`remoteServerAddress` properties. Use the [hotspot=jmsQueue file=1]`jmsQueue` element to define the inventory message queue.

In your dev mode console for the `system` microservice, type `r` and press `enter/return` key to restart the Liberty instance so that Liberty reads the configuration changes. When you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

// =================================================================================================
// Running the application
// =================================================================================================

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-build.adoc[]

You can find the `inventory` microservice at the following URLs:

* http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems^]

You can also use `curl` command to retrieve the `hostname` and `systemLoad` information from the `inventory/systems` server endpoint in another command line session:
```
curl http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems
```

== Testing the inventory application

//similar to https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html#testing-the-inventory-application
//explain the test
While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests because they trigger a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. Because the application is a RESTful web service application, you can use JUnit and the RESTful web service Client API to write tests. In testing the functionality of the application, the scopes and dependencies are being tested.

----
include::finish/inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointIT.java[]
----

See the following descriptions of the test cases:

* [hotspot=testGetSystems file=0]`testGetSystems()` verifies that the hostname and the system load for each system in the inventory are not empty.

* [hotspot=testGetSystemsWithHost file=0]`testGetSystemsWithHost()` verifies that the hostname and system load returned by the `system` microservice match the ones stored in the `inventory` microservice and ensures they are not empty.

* [hotspot=testUnknownHost file=0]`testUnknownHost()` verifies that an unknown host or a host that does not expose their JVM system properties is correctly handled as an error.

// Running the tests
// =================================================================================================

=== Running the tests

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, you can run the tests by pressing the `enter/return` key from the command-line session where you started dev mode for the `inventory` microservice.

If the tests pass, you see a similar output to the following example:

[source, role='no_copy']

When you are done checking out the application, stop the Liberty instances by pressing `CTRL+C` in each command-line session where you ran the `system` and `inventory` microservices.

== Using IBM MQ as the messaging server - Optional

The application has been built and tested. In this section, you'll learn how to configure Liberty to use https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-container[IBM MQ container^] as the messaging server instead of the embedded Liberty Messaging Server.

Replace the `properties.wasJms` configuration by the [hotspot=properties.wmqjmsra file=3]`properties.wmqjmsra` configuration. All property values are defined in the `pom.xml` file that you replaced. Also, modify the `jmsQueue` property to set the [hotspot=baseQueueName file=3]`baseQueueName` value with the `${ibmmq-inventory-queue-name}` variable. Add the [hotspot=resourceAdapter file=3]`resourceAdapter` element like you did for the `inventory` microservice.


// start dev mode for the system and inventory services
Start the `inventory` microservice by running the following command in dev mode:
[role='command']
```
mvn -pl inventory liberty:dev
```

Next, open another command-line session, navigate to the `start` directory, and start the `system` microservice by using the following command:
[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
```

When you see the following message, your Liberty instances are ready in dev mode:
[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

You can access the `inventory` microservice by the http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems URL.

In the command shell where `inventory` dev mode is running, press `enter/return` to run the tests. If the tests pass, you'll see output that is similar to the following example:

[source, role='no_copy']

----

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Liberty instances by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran the `system` and `inventory` microservices.

Run the following commands to stop the running IBM MQ container and clean up the `qm1data` volume:

[role=command]
```
docker stop QM1
docker rm QM1
docker volume remove qm1data
```

== Great work! You're done!

You just developed a Java cloud-native application that uses Jakarta Messaging to produce and consume messages in Open Liberty.
